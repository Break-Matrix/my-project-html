<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Sidhartha, a middle-class visionary with aspirations that transcend boundaries, am not just a coder or sports enthusiast;

  I sees opportunities to break free from conventional boundaries and carve a unique path.</p>

  <p>The eagerness to learn is not a passive trait but an active pursuit for me . Each day is a step closer to breaking the matrixâ€”mastering new coding languages, 
    deciphering market trends, and embracing challenges with open arms. 
    The middle-class background only serves as a launchpad for my bigger dreams, propelling me toward a future where limitations are shattered.</p>

  <p>In essence,I am  more than a coder or a sports enthusiast;
